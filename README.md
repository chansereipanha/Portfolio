This is a responsive portfolio website with 4 different pages. Once the website is shrink down to width: 900px and width: 420px for mobile, the website will turned into a website made for tablet and mobile phone. Changes are made throughout the website when this happens. One such example is the navbar where a hamburger menu will replace the navbar on tablet and mobile phone.
